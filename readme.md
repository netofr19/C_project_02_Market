# Project 2 - Market

## Description:

We must develop an application where, when launched, it presents the user with a menu where it is possible to register, list and purchase products, in addition to viewing the shopping cart or exiting the application.

When adding a product to the shopping cart, you must check whether the same product already exists in the cart and if so, simply change the quantity of the product in the cart.

When completing the purchase, the user must be presented with the total according to the products and quantities entered in the shopping cart.
